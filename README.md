# Mouse-Jiggler
A tiny Windows tool which prevents your computer from going to sleep or shutting down, by jiggling the mouse every so often.

## Why you need this
Windows machines have a built-in feature that puts the computer to sleep, or shuts it down, when the user doesn't use the computer for a specified amount of time.

For many users, this causes more trouble than it solves. On your own computer, you can easily fix this issue by modifying the power settings of Windows. However, on your work computer, you often don't have the required permission to change those settings. This means that you can move away from your computer for **five minutes**, only to find that it has hibernated itself. The solution: Mouse Jiggler!

## How it works
You run Mouse Jiggler on your computer and let it do its magic. There is no installation required. All you need is the standalone EXE file. You can also add Mouse Jiggler to your Windows startup so that you never forget to run it.

The interface is very light and minimalistic. You can find Mouse Jiggler's icon in the system tray (next to the clock on the bottom right). From there, you can close it if you wish.

Every minute (60 seconds), Mouse Jiggler moves your mouse just a bit and then moves it back to its initial position. All of this is done within less than a second, so you will barely notice it. By doing this, your computer won't get flagged as idle, and it won't go to sleep or shut down.

## More details
Mouse Jiggler is written using AutoHotkey. Therefore, it is only available on Windows. The executable file is also made using AutoHotkey's built-in script compiler (*Ahk2Exe*).
